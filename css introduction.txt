Inline css- It is introduced inside of the start tag
of an element by use of the style attribute.
Later you can have the different properties of 
a tag element.

internal css - It is embedded in the same document
inside of the head section. It is introduced by the 
use of the style tag element inside of the head
section of the html document. To style the different 
tags we normally use selectors. (Tag selector)

external css - This is where we create an external file
and save it with a dot css (.css) extension and link
both the html file and the css file by the use of the link 
tag element inside of the head section.
The link tag element comes with two very important attributes
i.e rel => Relationship and href => Where the css file is. (url)

Css Box Model properties:
1. Border => It takes three parameter for its value :a) weight b) color
   c) type
2. padding => This is the area between the content of the tag element
and the border.

3. margin => This is the area outside of the box model/border.


CSS Classes and IDs
1. IDs selectors => It is used to uniquely identify a tag element and style
it differently from other elements. To use an id as a selector you need to 
preceed writing the name of the id by use of a hash (#). An id is introduced
by the use of the id attribute.

2. Class selectors => They are used to style several tag elements with the
same styling. To use a class as a selector, you preceed writing the name of
the class by use of the period/full stop. (.)
